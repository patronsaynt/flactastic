    /// `enabled` additionally gates the *entire initial burst*: when a grid
    /// first populates, dozens of cells can call this within the same
    /// render pass, each scheduling its own `withAnimation` — animating
    /// that many cells simultaneously is itself a source of stutter,
    /// independent of which ones have been seen before. Pass `enabled:
    /// false` for that first synchronous pass (e.g. via a `@State` that
    /// starts `false` and flips `true` in a `.task` shortly after the view
    /// appears) so the bulk reveal renders instantly; anything that shows up
    /// afterward (search results, continued scrolling) still animates.
